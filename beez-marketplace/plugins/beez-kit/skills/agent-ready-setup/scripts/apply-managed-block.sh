# apply-managed-block.sh
# Applies the verbatim AGENTS.md managed block from the stack template without
# invoking any provider, so the current session sees new rule references
# immediately. Creates AGENTS.md when it does not exist. A legacy AGENTS.md
# without managed markers is left for merge-instructions.sh, whose provider
# review migrates it. SessionStart sync runs this before launching that review
# in the background.
#
# Usage:
#   bash apply-managed-block.sh --stack <frontend|node|java|go> --skill-dir <path>
