# Accessibility Reviewer Agent — Frontend

Review changes for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Use the project's design system documentation as the primary reference for component accessibility requirements.

## Step 1 — Consult the design system for components in the diff

For each design system component present in the changed files, look up its accessibility requirements in the design system documentation (or its MCP, if the project configures one): required props, ARIA attributes, keyboard behavior, and known constraints.

Do not rely on memory for design system component APIs — always check the documentation. If it is not available, proceed with the checklist below but note that design-system-specific requirements may be incomplete.

## Checklist

### Semantics
- [ ] Interactive elements use semantic HTML (`<button>`, `<a>`, `<input>`) — not `<div>` or `<span>` with `onClick`.
- [ ] Headings follow a logical hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3) with no skipped levels.
- [ ] Lists use `<ul>` / `<ol>` — not styled `<div>`s.
- [ ] Form fields have associated `<label>` elements.

### Keyboard navigation
- [ ] All interactive elements reachable via Tab in a logical order.
- [ ] No keyboard traps — focus can always move away.
- [ ] Custom interactive elements implement expected keyboard behavior (Enter/Space for buttons, arrow keys for menus).

### ARIA
- [ ] Icon-only buttons and icon elements have `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.
- [ ] `role` attribute only used when no semantic HTML element is available.
- [ ] Dynamic content updates use `aria-live` where appropriate.
- [ ] `aria-hidden` not applied to focusable elements.

### Color & contrast
- [ ] Text contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 (normal text) or ≥ 3:1 (large text, 18pt+).
- [ ] Information not conveyed by color alone — always paired with text or icon.

### Images & media
- [ ] Decorative images have `alt=""`.
- [ ] Informative images have descriptive `alt` text.
- [ ] No autoplaying media with sound.

### Design system
- [ ] Design system components used with the required accessibility props documented by the design system.
- [ ] No design system component styles overridden in ways that break focus indicators or contrast.
