description: Diagnose failing or flaky tests without blindly modifying assertions or mocks to get green builds. Use when the user is asked to fix tests, address regressions, resolve test-vs-implementation mismatches, inspect whether tests are outdated after recent code changes, or decide whether the correct fix belongs in the test, the implementation, or both.
---

## Quick Start

- Preserve the test's intent before changing anything.
- Inspect the failing test, implementation, and relevant git history together; do not treat the test as the automatic source of truth.
- Respect the requested edit scope: if the user asked to update tests only, or did not clearly authorize production edits, do not modify implementation files without confirmation.
- Fix the smallest surface that restores the intended behavior.
- Run the relevant tests after the change and verify they pass.

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze the failing test

- Identify the behavior the test is validating.
- Decide whether the expectation matches the real specification, business rule, or public contract.
- Check whether the setup, fixtures, mocks, or test data introduce a false assumption.

### 2. Check recent code history

- Inspect recent commits touching the failing behavior, nearby implementation, fixtures, mocks, contracts, and adjacent tests.
- Use git evidence such as `git log --oneline -- <paths>`, `git show`, `git blame`, or branch diffs to understand whether production behavior changed intentionally.
- Look for a related implementation change where the code evolved but the test expectation, fixture, mock, or asserted contract was not updated.
- Treat the failing test as deprecated or stale when history shows an intentional behavior, API, shape, copy, or contract change that the test did not follow.

### 3. Evaluate the implementation

- Confirm whether the current code matches the intended behavior.
- Look for regressions, missing branches, broken edge-case handling, or invalid output shape.
- Prefer reading adjacent tests and nearby call sites when intent is ambiguous.

### 4. Decide where to fix

- Fix the test when the expectation is outdated, deprecated, not updated after an intentional code change, the mock/setup is invalid, or the asserted behavior is not the real requirement.
- Fix the implementation when the test correctly represents the intended behavior and the code violates it.
- Fix both sides only when each is partially wrong, and keep the changes minimal.

### 5. Apply the scope gate before editing

- If the user explicitly says "tests only", "solo tests", or equivalent, modify only test files.
- If the user asks broadly to "fix tests" and the root cause is in implementation code, stop before editing production files. Report the evidence, explain that test-only changes cannot make the suite pass honestly, and ask for confirmation before touching implementation.
- If there are valid test-side issues, apply those first, then rerun the relevant tests and report any remaining implementation parse/runtime failures as blockers.
- Do not mock, skip, or bypass production imports just to satisfy a test-only scope when doing so would hide the real failure.

## Allowed Changes

- Correct assertions that contradict the real contract.
- Replace misleading mocks or fixtures with valid ones.
- Update implementation logic to satisfy correct expectations only when production edits are authorized by the user or clearly within the requested scope.
- Add or adjust focused tests when coverage is missing around the corrected behavior.

## Forbidden Changes

- Remove assertions only to make the suite pass.
- Replace precise checks with weaker matchers without a behavior-based reason.
- Skip, mute, or disable failing tests as a shortcut.
- Change expected values arbitrarily.
- Mock around the bug in a way that hides the real issue.

## Decision Heuristics

- Treat public behavior, business rules, and stable contracts as the source of truth.
- Treat test expectations as evidence, not proof. A failing test can be stale after product or contract changes.
- If the failure comes from a renamed field, changed API contract, updated requirement, or changed output shape, prefer updating the test only after verifying through commits, docs, types, call sites, or adjacent tests that the implementation is intentionally correct.
- If git history shows a related production change without corresponding test updates, assume the test may be outdated and verify intent before changing production code.
- If the failure exposes a regression in data handling, control flow, validation, or side effects, prefer fixing the implementation.
- If the intent is unclear, gather evidence first from neighboring tests, docs, types, routes, serializers, or UI expectations before editing.

## Output Requirements

- State whether the root cause was in the test, the implementation, or both.
- Briefly explain why that is the correct place to fix.
- When fixing a stale test, mention the commit or change evidence that showed the test was outdated.
- State when the requested scope prevented the root-cause fix, including the specific production files or modules still blocking the suite.
- Apply minimal, targeted changes.
- Keep tests and implementation aligned with the same intended behavior.

## Review Standard

- Do not stop at "tests are green."
- Verify that the final assertions still prove something meaningful.
- Prefer strong, behavior-oriented validations over broad or incidental checks.
