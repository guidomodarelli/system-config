description: Apply React render-performance and update-priority patterns (startTransition/useDeferredValue for input responsiveness, useMemo/useCallback/React.memo to cut re-renders, equality guards before setState, stable identities, O(1) lookup maps, and library-specific reset/identity gotchas). Use this skill whenever the user reports or wants to prevent UI jank, typing lag, frozen pages, "Maximum update depth exceeded", slow tables/lists/grids/filters, or asks to optimize, memoize, speed up, or reduce re-renders in any React/Next.js component — even when they don't name a specific API. Also use when porting the data-table optimizations to other components or projects.

# React Render Performance Patterns

Battle-tested patterns extracted from optimizing a heavy filterable data table (hundreds of cells with popovers, tooltips and per-row menus) where every keystroke was triggering several full re-renders and hanging the page. The goal of these patterns is the same everywhere: **keep urgent interactions (typing, clicking, dropdown selection) instant while heavy work happens off the critical path, and stop re-renders that produce no visible change.**

Use these as a toolkit, not a checklist. Measure first, apply the pattern that fits the bottleneck, and always explain *why* a given change helps.

## Diagnose before optimizing

Memoization is not free — it adds dependency arrays, allocates closures, and obscures data flow. Apply it where there is a real cost, not reflexively. Before changing anything, locate the bottleneck:

1. **What feels slow?** Typing lag, slow filter/sort, janky scroll, frozen click. The symptom points to the fix: input lag → update priority (transitions); slow derived data → memoize the computation; child re-renders → stable props + `React.memo`.
2. **What re-renders on each interaction, and is the work necessary?** Use React DevTools Profiler (or "Highlight updates"). A component re-rendering is only a problem if its render is expensive or it cascades to expensive children.
3. **Is the same value being recomputed or the same state being set to an equal value?** That is the cheapest win — guard it (see Equality guards).

Order of attack that usually works: **fix update priority → memoize the expensive derived data → stabilize identities so memo/`React.memo` actually hold → add equality guards for no-op updates → fix library-specific reset/identity gotchas.**

## Pattern 1 — Split urgent from non-urgent with `startTransition`

When one event must do two things — one cheap and user-facing (keep the input and its suggestions responsive) and one expensive (re-filter/re-render a large tree) — run the cheap update urgently and wrap the expensive one in a transition so React can interrupt it for the next keystroke.

```tsx
const handleQueryChange = useCallback((nextQuery: string) => {
  // Urgent: the input and its suggestions dropdown must respond to every key.
  setQueryDraft(nextQuery);

  // Non-urgent: re-filtering re-renders the whole table. Defer it as a
  // low-priority transition so typing never blocks behind the filter pass.
  startTransition(() => {
    setAppliedFilters(parseQuery(nextQuery));
  });
}, []);
```

Why it works: state updates inside `startTransition` are interruptible. If the user types again before the heavy render finishes, React throws away the in-progress render and starts fresh, so the input never stutters.

Notes:
- The urgent update (`setQueryDraft`) must stay **outside** the transition, or it loses its priority.
- `useDeferredValue(value)` is the read-side equivalent: when you receive an expensive value as a prop and want to render a lagging copy without owning the setter, derive `const deferred = useDeferredValue(value)` and feed `deferred` to the expensive subtree. Reach for it when you can't wrap the setter.
- Optionally surface `const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition()` to dim/spinner the stale region while the transition runs.

## Pattern 2 — Memoize the expensive subtree, with deps chosen deliberately

The most expensive thing to render is usually a list/table body. Memoize the *rendered nodes* so unrelated local state (a toolbar draft, focus, an input value) does not rebuild the whole body.

```tsx
const tableBodyRows = useMemo(() => {
  return rowModelRows.map((row) => (
    <TableRow key={row.id}>
      {row.getVisibleCells().map((cell) => (
        <TableCell key={cell.id}>{renderCell(cell)}</TableCell>
      ))}
    </TableRow>
  ));
  // columnVisibility is included on purpose: it changes which cells render
  // without changing the rowModelRows reference, so it must invalidate the memo.
  // emptyMessage is kept OUT on purpose: it flips between filtered/unfiltered
  // and would needlessly rebuild every row on the first keystroke.
}, [columnVisibility, renderCell, rowModelRows]);
```

The dependency array is the whole game:
- **Include** every value that changes *what is rendered* even if the linter can't see it referenced lexically (here `columnVisibility` toggles `getVisibleCells()` output). Document why.
- **Exclude**, deliberately and with a comment, values that change on every interaction but don't affect this subtree — pulling them in silently re-renders everything you were trying to protect.
- When you intentionally diverge from `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`, leave the `// eslint-disable-next-line` plus a comment explaining the choice, so the next reader doesn't "fix" it back into a perf bug.

## Pattern 3 — Memoize derived data as a pipeline

When data flows through several transforms (filter → exclude → predicate → sort), memoize each stage with precise deps so a change in one input only recomputes downstream of it, not the whole chain.

```tsx
const rowsMatchingFilter   = useMemo(() => match(rows, query),        [rows, query]);
const rowsExcluding        = useMemo(() => exclude(rowsMatchingFilter, excluded), [rowsMatchingFilter, excluded]);
const rowsForTable         = useMemo(() => sort(rowsExcluding, sorting),          [rowsExcluding, sorting]);
```

Each `useMemo` returns a stable reference when its inputs are unchanged, which keeps the *next* stage's memo (and any `React.memo` child consuming it) from invalidating. The chain is only as good as its weakest reference — one stage that rebuilds an array every render breaks every memo below it.

## Pattern 4 — Stabilize identities with `useCallback` and `React.memo`

`useMemo`/`React.memo` only help if the props feeding them keep a stable identity. An inline `onClick={() => ...}` or `columns={[...]}` rebuilt every render defeats every downstream memo.

- Wrap event handlers passed into memoized children or column definitions in `useCallback` with honest deps.
- Memoize `columns`/config objects with `useMemo` so the table/list doesn't see "new columns" each render.
- Wrap an expensive presentational child in `React.memo` so it skips re-render when its props are referentially equal. This pays off only when the parent re-renders often **and** the child's props are actually stable — otherwise it's overhead. Add a `displayName` for debuggability.

```tsx
const handleToggle = useCallback((id: string, checked: boolean) => {
  setSelected((prev) => withToggled(prev, id, checked));
}, []);

const PaymentCell = React.memo(function PaymentCell(props: PaymentCellProps) {
  /* expensive cell with popovers/menus */
});
```

## Pattern 5 — Guard against no-op state updates

Setting state to a value that is structurally equal still triggers a render (and invalidates memos that depend on it). When a handler fires on every keystroke, propagating equal values cascades into wasted re-renders of the whole tree. Compare first; bail when nothing changed.

```tsx
// In the setState updater: return the previous reference to short-circuit.
setColumnFilters((prev) => {
  const next = computeNext(prev);
  return areColumnFiltersEqual(prev, next) ? prev : next;
});

// Before propagating to channels: only push values that actually changed.
if (!areStringArraysEqual(parsed.excluded, currentExcluded)) {
  onExcludedChange(parsed.excluded);
}
```

Returning the *previous reference* from a `useState`/`useReducer` updater makes React bail out of the render entirely. Write small structural-equality helpers (`areStringArraysEqual`, `areColumnFiltersEqual`, …) rather than `JSON.stringify`, which allocates and is order-sensitive.

## Pattern 6 — Use O(1) lookup structures inside hot paths

Inside filters, predicates, and per-row render, an `array.includes`/`array.find` turns the pass into O(n·m). Build a `Map`/`Set` once (memoized) and look up in O(1).

```tsx
const lenderNamesById = useMemo(
  () => new Map(lenders.map((lender) => [lender.id, lender.name])),
  [lenders],
);
const selectedIds = useMemo(() => new Set(selection), [selection]);
// hot path: selectedIds.has(row.id)  // O(1) per row instead of O(n)
```

## Pattern 7 — Library reset/identity gotchas (TanStack Table & similar)

Headless data libraries keep internal reactive state; two recurring traps:

- **Auto-reset feedback loops.** Without pagination/expansion, leaving auto-resets on means each filter change calls `resetPageIndex` → `setPagination` → re-render → reset again: `Maximum update depth exceeded` and a frozen page while typing. Disable the resets you don't need: `autoResetPageIndex: false`, `autoResetExpanded: false`.
- **Don't depend on the library instance identity.** The `table` object is recreated on most renders. Memoizing on `[table]` never holds. Follow the library's own pattern: depend on the underlying data (`table.getRowModel().rows`) read into a local before the memo, not on `table` itself.

## Applying these to other components / projects

When porting these patterns elsewhere:
1. Reproduce and locate the bottleneck first (Diagnose section). Don't memoize blindly.
2. Match the symptom to the pattern: input lag → Pattern 1; expensive derived value → Patterns 2–3; child re-renders → Pattern 4; no-op updates → Pattern 5; O(n²) hot loop → Pattern 6; "max update depth"/headless lib → Pattern 7.
3. Keep the urgent path outside transitions and the heavy path inside them.
4. Leave a one-line comment on every non-obvious dependency-array choice and every intentional lint suppression — these are the lines that get silently reverted into regressions.
5. Verify: re-profile and confirm the re-render count / interaction latency actually dropped. A memo that doesn't reduce renders is just complexity.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- Memoizing trivially cheap values (a string concat, a `+`) — the bookkeeping costs more than it saves.
- `React.memo` on a component whose props change every render — pure overhead.
- `JSON.stringify` as an equality check in a hot path — allocates and is key-order sensitive.
- Suppressing `exhaustive-deps` without a comment — the next reader can't tell a deliberate exclusion from a bug.
- Wrapping the urgent UI update inside `startTransition` — it loses priority and the input lags anyway.
- Reaching for these patterns before measuring — premature memoization hides data flow and rarely targets the real cost.
